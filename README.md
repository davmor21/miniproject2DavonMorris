# Mini Project 2 - Pandas

## Description

The goal is to come up with a question and then see what API I can use to get the information needed to answer that question.

The choice I made was based on an API for dog breeds on [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Installing

* Clone my repository to your IDE configured to run Python 3.12
* Optional - Create directory named "charts", if not created the script will do it for you

### Executing program

* Create an interpreter for this project
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Create a file named config.py
* Go to [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com) and create a profile, and put your API key in the config.py file in this format:
```angular2html
dogs_api_url = 'https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/dogs?name={}'.format(name)
dogs_api_key = "API Key HERE"
```
